# EmbeddedChromiumFpCef3Lazarus
Create your own automation browser simulation tools, parsers, and scrapers using the embedded Chromium browser fpCef3 in the Lazarus IDE.

Compatibility: Works with Windows x64 systems. For other systems, download the necessary libraries (minimal versions) from CEF Builds.

Additional Files: Not all files are available on GitHub. Larger files, such as cef_sandbox.lib, can be found on my Google Drive. https://drive.google.com/open?id=1I6ckdkWcXBmgmnCjc--YVSZtY0-gOI2k

Copy the contents of the 'Resources' and 'Release' folders into your projectâ€™s folder, where the executable (.exe) file will reside.
